							<h2>The everyday objects we acquire—the intentional, treasured ones, and the forgotten, everyday “junk”—tell a story about our lives.</h2>
						</header>	
							<img src="images/ruler.png" align=left width=325px>
						<p>Tucked in my school bag—among pens, charging cords, gum wrappers, scissors, a glue stick, a coffee shop gift card (all the essentials for an English PhD student with a soft spot for art)—is a tiny, wooden, ruler. It appears to be a decades-old promotional item, branded with “The Ohio Butterine Company,” and suggesting its function—“for the lady’s work basket.” (I suppose my school bag is a “lady’s work basket” of sorts, though perhaps not the type the designers had in mind.) I use the ruler surprisingly often—to draw dividing lines in class notes, to guide my highlighters, to cross items neatly off my to-do list.</p>
						<p>I discovered the ruler in a drawer of household items at my grandma’s house, shortly after her death in early 2023. It wasn’t particularly sentimental to me—I don’t even remember my grandma using this ruler. Something about its uniquely small design, its everyday function, and its history as a free giveaway appealed to me, though. And in many ways, it represented my grandma more perfectly than any fancy heirloom. </p>
						<p>My grandma, Millie, was a collector of many things. My sister affectionately dubbed her “an organized hoarder.” A child of the Great Depression, Millie never threw anything away. She saved, repaired, and reused—perhaps to a radical extreme. Some of my earliest memories with my grandma include hunting for bargain treasures at “St. Vinnies,” her local thrift store, and walking booth to booth, collecting free magnets, pens, buttons (and probably my ruler) from vendors at the county fair. </p>
						<p>Millie especially took pride in rescuing discarded, forgotten “junk”. She would pick through piles of abandoned housewares and tools on the curb awaiting trash pickup (a habit readily continued today by my aunts and father). She repaired damaged clothing, resurrected shriveled houseplants, and packed her pantry and freezer with nearly-expired food from the grocery store discount shelf.</p>
						<h3>To my grandma, the value of objects had little to do with money.</h3> 
						<h3>Instead, she found satisfaction in restoring value to the things other people considered damaged, disposable, and obsolete. She saw the potential in the objects that other people left behind.</h3>
						<p>In her audio essay, <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/832/that-other-guy/act-three-7" target="_blank">“You, Me, and Her,”</a> author Marie Phillips describes the intimate, uncanny, sometimes-awkward experience of moving into her new partner’s home—a home he had shared for years with his recently-deceased wife. Phillips recalls, “Every object [in the house], no matter how trivial, spoke of a life interrupted. A hair elastic. Once upon a time, a person—not just any person, my partner's wife—had used it to tie her hair back. And now she was dead, and I was deciding whether I wanted to use that same elastic to tie my own hair back…it felt wrong, like I was taking her life piece by tiny piece.” By living alongside the objects that once belonged to her partner’s wife, Phillips felt, at times, like his wife was living alongside them. In some ways, her material life did continue—through the objects that remained in the house where she had spent the final years of her life.</p>	
						<p>All our lives are made up of material pieces—the objects we keep, store, and treasure, along with the objects we acquire by chance, toss in a junk drawer (or closet, or basement, or under a bed), and forget about entirely. When these items are passed down through a family, they take on new definitions and meanings for their new owners, while maintaining memories and meaning from the past.  Jamie White-Farnham calls these everyday objects passed through a family "rhetorical heirlooms."  </p>	
						<h3>How do my grandma’s objects, collected for nearly a century, reveal her changing identity, values, and social roles throughout the span of her life?</h3>
						<h3>What does the afterlife of these objects—in the homes of my aunts, uncles, cousins, and others—reveal about their ongoing influence?</h3>
						<h3>How has the role and meaning of these objects evolved to tell new stories in the lives of their new owners?</h3>
						<p> Physical objects anchor us to the world—they make tangible the memories, relationships, and ideas about ourselves that make up a lifespan (Berry et al). Millie’s objects tell a story about who she was, and how she grew throughout her life—from a young wife and mother (of seven children!), a woman of faith, a cook, a thrifter, and more. Millie’s objects come together to compose a story of her 97 years—but they don’t end with her. They live on—in her family members, friends, and caregivers who have brought her objects into their own lives and their own stories.</p>
						<hr>
						<h2>(Inevitably Messy) Methods</h2>
						<p>For this project, I asked my family members to share one or more items that they currently own that once belonged to my grandma. I contacted all of Millie’s children and their spouses (my parents and aunts/uncles), along with their children (my cousins and siblings). I encouraged them to share the survey more broadly, with extended relatives or other people who knew my grandma and might have items that once belonged to her.</p>
						<p>While some research in sociology and developmental psychology has been done in the particular types of objects people acquire and value at different ages and stages in life (Kampter; Deller), I was more interested in the memories and stories associated with objects for my family members. I asked them to share the function the item serves (if any) in their daily life today, along with where it “lives” within their home or elsewhere. (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-nnxg1B8pKtg7Np97OqO0KORlKJJFcNR4g4UooG6Bh0/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Click here</a> for the full text of my initial email survey and list of questions.) I also asked them to share photos of the object, ideally with them, or in the context of its current home or role in their lives.</p>
						<p>After some cajoling and reminders, I received responses from five of Millie’s children, two of their spouses, and four of her grandchildren. Many apologized and joked about replying late or last-minute, invoking the common family affliction, a wordplay of our family name—being “procrasti-Naderers”. The eleven people who responded shared a total of sixteen objects. </p>
						<p>I sorted the objects into four general themes, based on the responses shared by my family members—identity (objects that helped define/understand my grandma), relationships (objects that connected them to her), values (objects that represent my grandma’s values, the contributor’s values, or both), and legacy (objects that have taken on new life or meaning in their new home).</p>
						<p>Like most methods in participatory research—especially when working with memory and relationships—this process is messy! Many objects could fit into multiple categories. Ideas and feelings don’t fit into neat boxes. Sometimes they overlap, contradict each other, or float from one theme to another in unpredictable ways. My goal is not necessarily to cleanly sort and categorize, but to share some themes that the objects, taken together, help to illuminate.</p>

						<h2>Composing Identity</h2>
						<p>The collection, preservation, and display of everyday objects is a complex process that tells a story. Drawing on Judy Shipka’s inclusive definition of composition in Toward a Composition Made Whole, I believe significant meaning can be found in studying the collection and curation of everyday objects throughout the course of a life. Shipka argues that composition is “an act of communication that can be expressed through any number of media and as a path to meaning-making.” Much like a personal narrative, a diary, or a memoir expresses ideas about self-identity and understanding, the material objects a person collects throughout their lifetime can tell a story about who someone understands themselves to be.</p>
						<p>Many of the objects my family members chose to share with me tell a story about my grandma’s identity—or, at least, their perspective of who she was. They shared objects that represented Millie’s role as a provider and caregiver. A woman who liked nice things, but didn’t splurge on herself. Someone who had deep faith, and wasn’t afraid to laugh at her own flaws. </p>

							<h2>Anchoring Relationships</h2>
						<p>Relationships can be hard to define, and we often turn to objects as material expressions (or evidence) of our connection to others. As Sherry Turkle argues in her book Evocative Objects, the objects we surround ourselves with are significant conduits of our own thinking and learning. Turkle explains that the objects in our lives “stabilize our sense of who we are; they give a permanent shape to our views of ourselves that otherwise would quickly dissolve in the flux of consciousness.” Objects remind us of the people we care about—the fleeting memories that anchor our connections to them.</p>
						<p>Some family members shared objects that represented their relationship with Millie—objects that reminded them of happy memories they shared together, or that helped them remember their connection more clearly. Some objects represented her relationships with not only them, but others who she loved, including her husband, my grandpa, who died twenty years ago. </p>

						<h2>Illustrating Values</h2>
						<p>Objects help us, as humans, represent our beliefs and values—these concepts that are often intangible, emotional, or fleeting—in concrete, material ways. Objects have been used in religious rituals, grief practices, memorials, and other ceremonies for centuries (Downes, et al). Similarly, we fill our personal spaces with objects that represent our values. At the same time, other objects we hold onto come to reflect our values in less explicit, subconscious ways. </p>
						<p>For my grandma, her Catholic faith was a centerpiece of her life. This faith is reflected in many of the objects shared by my family members—whether they share the same beliefs and practices, or not. In addition to Millie’s religious faith, she valued hard work, caregiving, and stewardship. She instilled these values in her family, guiding them to pray, to work hard, to care for each other, and to find new value in broken or discarded things.</p>

						<h2>Continuing the Story</h2>
						<p>Family storytelling is not always linear. We learn stories from older family members—and then we retell and redefine them with our own identities, memories, and life experiences. As Yvonne Lee explains, “Literacy development does indeed possess a multidirectional nature, moving back and forth along generational lines” (128). When it comes to the material objects that tell a story of a family, this idea of multidirectional literacy is just as relevant. We take on objects, bring them into our lives, and redefine what they meant to our older family members in the first place.</p>
						<p>Some objects my family members shared look toward the future. They represent new traditions and new family members. The legacies of these objects exist beyond the purposes my grandma had for them. In some ways, they represent the next chapter—the afterlife—of her story.</p>

						<h2>Conclusion</h2>
						<p>When looking at the way we tell the stories of our lives, we must consider the everyday objects. The material things we surround ourselves with play an essential role in defining who we are, what we care about, and how we form relationships. These objects can rarely be appraised by their monetary “value”—rather, their worth is ever-changing. A tiny ruler, handed out for free by a vendor at the county fair, becomes a helpful tool in my school bag, missed during class if it’s forgotten on the table at home. A nut mill, or fake designer bag, or a toy truck rescued from the dumpster become reminders to treat yourself and the people you love, even if you don’t have much money to spend. A  broken novelty birdcage becomes a representation of the value of repair and resourcefulness shared between a mother and son.</p>
						<p>When studying the lifespan, we cannot study one life alone. The way our objects influence our stories—and the way we tell those stories together, continuing through time, are all part of understanding Millie’s life—and, in turn, our own.</p>
